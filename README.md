## Summary

The purpose of this Teams Toolkit Tab sample is to render M365 Group Plan tasks in a timeline ordered by the task due date with tags for years and months in a vertical stack. There are filter options to filter out completed tasks and tender tasks by a plan bucket. A task's detail can be viewed by clicking the (i) icon below the "Due Date" popping up a callout dialog with task details. It Should be noted that a M365 Group Planner can have 0 to 200 plans assigned to M365 Group. When configuring a Planner Timeline tab you must select the plan to be rendered, along with options for the plan bucket and completed task filter. These setting will be used when the tab is access. The configuration of multiple tab for different plans and buckets are supported.

Single sign-on authentication is used to access M365 Groups Planner data in Microsoft Graph. 
</br><mark>To complete the approval of Microsoft Graph permission, an Admin will need to Accept the permission request.</mark>

- This sample was generated with Teams Toolkit as a "Tab => React with Fluent UI => Typescript".
- React Hooks is used in the web app.
- The Azure Function, not needed and has been deleted from the sample.
- The bicep files has been modified to only provision the static wab service in Azure.

_Teams Toolkit pulls in some standard libraries and SDK's to Create React App. Since these are aligned with Teams Toolkit versions._

_To support accessing to Planner data  structures returned by Microsoft Graph, "Microsoft Graph Types" module is used._

## Prerequisites

> - A [Microsoft 365 account for development](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts)

> - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 18, 20
> - Set up and install Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code v5.0 [How to install Teams Toolkit v5.0](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/install-teams-toolkit?tabs=vscode).
> - [Set up your dev environment for extending Teams apps across Microsoft 365](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-m365-apps-prerequisites)
>   Please note that after you enrolled your developer tenant in Office 365 Target Release, it may take couple days for the enrollment to take effect.
> - [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version 5.10.1 or higher and the [Teams Toolkit CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-toolkit-cli)

## Minimal path to awesome - Debug against a real Microsoft 365 tenant

- Clone repo
- Open repo in VSCode
- First, select the Teams Toolkit icon on the left in the VS Code toolbar.
- In the Account section, sign in with your [Microsoft 365 account](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts) if you haven't already.
- Before running the Teams Tab code, you need to copy the following file in the "env" folder:
>>- .env.local.sample --> ,env,local
>>- .env.local.user.sample --> .env.local.user
- Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to start debugging which launches your app in Teams using a web browser. Select `Debug (Edge)` or `Debug (Chrome)`.
- When Teams launches in the browser, select the Add button in the dialog to install your app to Teams.
- Wait for deploy and provision tasks to complete.
- The first time you run the code you will need to "Authorize permission to access Planner Tasks" 
    <p>
        <img src="images/Authorize.gif" width=550>
    </p>

- On initial app run, Allow the following Graph API permissions via the consent prompt. </br> <mark>Make sure popups are allowed in the browser to see the consent prompot</mark>.

    >|Graph API Permissions|Admin Consent required|
    >|-|-|
    >|User.Read.All|<mark>Yes</mark>|
    >|Tasks.Read|No|
    >|GroupMember.Read.All|<mark>Yes</mark>|

- Because Microsoft Graph API permissions "GroupMember.Read.All" and "User.Read.All" both require Admin Consent,</br>
the initial add of Planner Timeline tab to a channel should be an admin with rights to "Consent on behalf of your organization".</br>
If this in not the case the Microsoft Graph API permissions will need to be consented in the Microsoft Entra admin center,</br>
App registration with the display name "PlannerTimeline".</br>

    <img src="images/Accept-Permissions.gif" width=400>

- The Planner Timeline renders the a Plan in the group of Teams of the Channel added to.
- Can be added for different plans and buckets in any of the Teams Channels.

### Note: ###
To add a Planner Timeline app to Teams channel the Teams M365 Group must have a Plan assigned to the Group. To add a Plan, use the Planner App (tab) to create a new Plan for to the M365 Group in it's configuration dialog. You will be unable to add the Planner Timeline App to the channel without a M365 Group Panner.
